# Serverless Todo Backend with Cloudflare and Hono.js

This repository provides an example of a serverless backend for a Todo application using Cloudflare Workers and Hono.js. It demonstrates basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing Todo items.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js and npm: [Download and Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- Wrangler CLI: Install the Cloudflare Wrangler CLI using npm.

  ```bash
  npm install -g @cloudflare/wrangler
  ```

### Installation

1. Create a new Hono.js app using npm:

   ```bash
   npm create hono@latest my-app
   ```

   Follow the prompts to set up your Hono.js app.

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd my-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up your Cloudflare account and configure Wrangler:

   - Run `wrangler login` and follow the prompts to log in to your Cloudflare account.
   - Create a `wrangler.toml` configuration file:

     ```toml
     name = "your-project-name"
     type = "javascript"
     account_id = "your-cloudflare-account-id"
     workers_dev = true
     route = ""
     ```

### Usage

- **Development:**

  Run the development server with Wrangler:

  ```bash
  wrangler dev
  ```

  This will start a local server, and you can test your API endpoints at `http://localhost:8787`.

- **Production Deployment:**

  Deploy your serverless backend to Cloudflare Workers:

  ```bash
  wrangler publish
  ```

  Follow the link provided to access your live serverless API.
